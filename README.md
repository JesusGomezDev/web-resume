# Web Resume

This project is a personalized version of my resume, based on the [cv](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/cv) project by [Bartosz Jarocki](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki) and coded based on the [minimalist-portfolio-json](https://github.com/midudev/minimalist-portfolio-json) project by [midudev](https://github.com/midudev).

I have modified the original design and added Tailwind CSS for styles, which has allowed me to customize the look and feel of my portfolio to my liking.
